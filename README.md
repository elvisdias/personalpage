I've managed to create this personal page to be my enterily designed and thoughtout online home. I'm not experienced with web development whatsoever, but the idea here is to have a place to present anything I feel like, from a stalled home page. Do not expect much sense or estability from it, just creation.

I hope I can keep up! :sparkles:
